# Kajabi UXD Candidate Code Challenge

Welcome! We're excited you're interested in joining the Kajabi UX Developer (UXD) team! This code challenge gives you an opportunity to show us where you are in relation to crucial skills for day to day work at Kajabi.

## Your task, should you choose to accept it...

THe overall goal of this challenge is to create a prototype component using HTML and CSS based on a provided design mockup. We hope this work takes no more than a few hours to complete and we've tried to give you as much as possible for you to jump right in on the task.

Here's the process:

1. Review [this Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/XfwsvOqsrt4nLTUCHdcBP7/Challenge-Latest?node-id=0%3A1) for a fictitious new component that is similar to something you might build on the job with us. _Note:_ If you're new to Figma, that's ok! See the section below, "Regarding Figma."
1. Use the starter fileset provided in this repo within the `src/` folder to recreate this component. 

    As you plan your approach consider the following:
    
    - Match the component mockup as closely as you can. We are interested in seeing how you would build this using contemporary HTML and CSS techniques.
    - You are welcome to use plain HTML and CSS in the provided `src/index.html` and `src/styles.css`. However, if you're familiar with Sass you can also use the minimal build process we've set up here. Either way, see "Regarding local development" below for some tips regarding the setup we've provided to help you get going on the task.
    - No interactivity is required or expected here. While we complete our work in a Rails and React environment on the job we do not expect you to showcase skills in these tools for this challenge.
    - We welcome (but do not require) additional considerations of responsive adjustments. Matching the mockup provided should be your first priority, but feel free to consider creative adjustments for smaller screens.
    - We don't expect you to use the newest, most "bleeding edge" features. Just show us what you know, where you are now. Don't overthink it ;). Simple, effective solutions are ideal.
    - While we hope to see the mockup built as shown, there may be aspects of the component that present some questions to you and affect your approach. Go ahead with your best guess or assumption but feel free to articulate your thought process in the provided `NOTES.md`.
    - Along these lines, please provide any additonal explanation or background on your solution in the `NOTES.md` file that you think would be helpful to those who review your solution.

1. When finished, ensure that your finished solution is contained on the `main` branch of your cloned version of this repository. Then **share your repo's URL with your primary contact at Kajabi.** They will pass it on to reviewers on the UXD team.

If you have any questions or concerns about the task or anything related to completing and submitting the project please let your primary contact at Kajabi know.

## Regarding Figma

***TBD: basic info an accessing Figma. Also will include a screen shot.***

## Regarding local development

***TBD: will embelish more soon. Gist for now:***

Get set up by installing Node.

Install necessary packages by running the following terminal command:

```
npm install
```

To work using a minimal development build process with Sass run:

```
npm start
```

Or if you'd prefer to write plain CSS you can add it in `styles.css` and at least fire up a reloading browser with:

```
npm run sync
```
